# Halo 3 Menus Website
This website aims to fully recreate the original Halo 3 menus that were used in the 2007 Xbox 360 video game. By painstakingly implementing every detail of the menus, this project showcases my ability to develop websites and game menus based on concept images provided. Although the website is still in development, these screenshots showcase the progress made so far. As the site progresses, this readme will be updated and changed.

# Purpose
The endgoal for this website is to showcase to employers how I can create websites and game menus based on wireframes and concept images provided. This is also intended for Halo 3 fans who would like to have this running on their other monitor. Like https://halome.nu/, you could leave this page running idly. However, unlike that other fan site, you could actually click through the menus and customize it to their likings.

# Progress
